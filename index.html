          According to Dr. Chandra Jackson, a researcher with The Social and Environmental Determinants of Health Equity Group, "many people of
          color have historically lived and continue to largely live in disadvantaged, obesogenic physical and social environments,"
          and as such, "these greater adverse exposures likely negatively affect sleep, resulting in physiological dysregulation. Physiological
          dysregulation may, in turn, lead to increased obesity risk and subsequent health consequences, which are likely more influential than
          potential genetic differences in race, a social construct." We explore some of these environmental factors in later sections.

            There is a bidirectional relationship between sleep and obesity - those who are already obese are more likely to
            have poorer sleep, and those with poorer sleep are more likely to become obese. There are numerous proposed mechanisms
            that contribute to this relationship.<br><br>

            <h2>Women getting less than the recommended amount of sleep (fewer than 8.4 hours each night)
              report being too sleepy to eat healthy foods or too sleepy to exercise, two behaviors
              that directly contribute to body weight.</h2>

          <h2>Access to healthy foods and indoor or outdoor facilitites to exercise can also be impacted by
            the neighborhood a woman lives in.</h2>

            For example, a food desert is an area, especially one with low-income residents, that has limited access
            to affordable and nutritious food. In contrast, an area with supermarkets or vegetable shops is a food oasis (citation needed).
            When tired due to insufficient sleep, it is even harder to find the motivation to seek out healthy food options.

        </h2>
          The majority of women report never being kept awake at night worrying about financial matters, but for women from households that make under $15k, they are more likely to worry about financial matters at bedtime, and if they report worrying every day, they are more than twice as likely to report taking over an hour to fall asleep.<br><br>

          <h2>A mental health condition like depression increases the variability of sleep.<br>
            <img src="images/chart9.png" width="70%" height="70%"></h2>
        Most women without a health condition report good sleep almost every night with a very short sleep onset latency (less than 15 minutes). Women with a mental health condition (like depression) have much more variable sleep quality and a long sleep latency contributes to reporting poor sleep quality.

        <h2>In contrast, sleep is less variable for women with high blood pressure.<br>
          <img src="images/chart8.png" width="70%" height="70%"></h2>
        Having high blood pressure doesn’t contribute as much to the likelihood of having poor
        sleep - this is a condition that might be easier to manage in relation to sleep than
        some others like anxiety and depression, for example, which often have symptomology
        directly related to sleep. Blood pressure conditions might be easier for certain
        populations (low SES, racial minorities, etc.) to get treatment for than mental
        health conditions like depression and anxiety (citation needed)<br><br>

            Women who reported being very satisfied with their relationship with their partner also reported having good sleep every night or almost every night.
            If you aren’t having very good sleep right now, consider how your interpersonal relationships may be impacting your sleep, especially if you share a bed with your partner. Unresolved issues with a partner may result in worrying or anxiety at bedtime, or may manifest in less-than-ideal sleeping situations (e.g., if partners are fighting and one is asked to sleep on the couch instead of in the bed).
